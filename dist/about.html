      <p>Our Valuation department provides its clients with a broad range of property valuations for cottages and summerhouses mainly in South Moravian Region. Drawing upon long-term experience across a broad field of services, our team of experts is able to prepare valuations even for quite specific types of properties, such as filling stations, farmland, silos, and others.</p>

     <p> Every year, we perform dozens of property valuations in an aggregate value of hundreds of millions of euros for our clients among banks, property developers, and investors; these valuations satisfy the criteria of both domestic and international standards.</p>

      <p>We provide these services for individual projects as well as for large real estate portfolios, based on their current state or on their expected future development. At every stage during the valuation process, we take great care to reflect a number of factors so as to provide our clients with the kind of comprehensive financial findings and observations they need.</p>
